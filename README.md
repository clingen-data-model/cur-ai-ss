# Curation AI Assistant (cur-ai-ss ... curious!)

Seeding a repository for building a new ClinGen curation ai assistant tool that builds on former work done on the [Evidence Aggregator](https://github.com/microsoft/healthfutures-evagg) work with Microsoft and ClinGen. The conceptual aim of this tool is to provide genomic analysts resources to reduce or eliminate toil and improve data curation efficiency and quality in the realms of Gene-Disease Validaty and Variant Pathogenicity curation activities in ClinGen.
