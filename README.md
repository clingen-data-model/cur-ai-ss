# Curation AI Assistant Pilot (cur-ai-ss ... curious!)

The ClinGen curation ai assistant tool repo is a pilot that builds on former work done on the [Evidence Aggregator](https://github.com/microsoft/healthfutures-evagg) with Microsoft and ClinGen. The conceptual aim of this pilot is to provide genomic analysts resources to reduce or eliminate toil and improve data curation efficiency and quality of Gene-Disease Validity curation activities in ClinGen.
