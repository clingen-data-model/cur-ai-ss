Extract all genetic variants associated with the gene {{$gene_symbol}} from the text above. 
Return them in a JSON object. Output no text other than the JSON.

Rules:
1. Accept any valid variant format, including but not limited to:
   - c. (coding DNA), n. (noncoding), g. (genomic), m. (mitochondrial), p. (protein)
   - rsIDs
   - amino acid changes (e.g., K34T, Ser195Gly)
   - chromosome-level variants (e.g., chr1:1234567A>T)
   - HGVS with reference sequences (e.g., NM_, NP_, NG_, NC_, ENST_, ENSP_)
   - natural-language descriptions of substitutions or amino-acid changes

2. If a variant contains both c. and p. notation together, split them into separate elements:
  - Attach any DNA-level reference (NM_, NG_, NC_, ENST_) to the c. variant.
  - Attach any protein-level reference (NP_, XP_, ENSP_) to the p. variant.
  - If only a single reference is provided and it is ambiguous, you may apply it to both the c. and p. variants.

3. Variants may appear separated by punctuation or whitespace. Normalize and split them.

4. A gene symbol may appear before the variant (e.g., "BRCA1 (c.123A>T)"). 
   In such cases, return only the variant, not the gene symbol.

5. Avoid returning the same logical variant twice unless it is unclear they refer to the same event.

6. Consider that capitalization of {{$gene_symbol}} may vary.

7. If no variants for {{$gene_symbol}} are found, return:
   {"variants": ["unknown"]}

Output format:
{
  "variants": ["..."]
}
